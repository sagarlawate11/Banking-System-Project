Internet is being widely used as means of communication and referred as window to the world. People now rely on the internet to search for information, to purchase merchandise and to be informed of different services provided by an organization. Most of the companies (emerging/existing) invest on their websites to promote themselves and the products &amp; services they offer.  As a result, one can purchase a product or utilize a service from any organization of their choice whenever they wish regardless of their location, which is all just a click away.
